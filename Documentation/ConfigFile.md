# SwiftGen Configuration File

In order to avoid invoking SwiftGen manually multiple times — one for each subcommand — and having to remember each arguments to pass every time, you can instead use a YAML configuration file to configure everything.

Simply create a YAML file named `swiftgen.yml` at the root of your repository with the structure described below, then just run `swiftgen` (without any argument).

> For more options (using a different file, checking your config file for errors…), see further below.

## Configuration File Format

The configuration file is a YAML file structured like this (example):

```yaml
input_dir: Sources/Resources
output_dir: Sources/Generated/
strings:
  inputs: Base.lproj
  filter: .*\.strings
  outputs:
    - templateName: structured-swift4
      output: L10n-Constants.swift
xcassets:
  - inputs: Logos.xcassets
    outputs:
      - templateName: swift4
        output: Logos-Constants.swift
        params:
          enumName: Logos
  - inputs:
      - Colors.xcassets
      - Images.xcassets
    outputs:
      - templatePath: Resources/my-assets-custom-template.stencil
        output: Assets-Constants.swift
```

ℹ️ All _relative_ paths specified in the configuration file (`input_dir`, `output_dir`, `inputs`, `templatePath`, `output`) are relative to the location of the _configuration file_ itself.

> 💡 We advise against using _absolute_ paths — starting with `/` — in the configuration file, so that they won't rely on where the project was cloned on your machine._

Here's a quick description of all the possible _root_ keys. All of them are optional.

| Key | Description | Intended usage |
|-----|-------------|----------------|
| `input_dir` | If present, it is prepended to all input `inputs` keys used in the rest of the configuration file | This is useful to avoid repeating any common subdirectory everywhere in each `inputs` key, when all your input paths are all in subdirectories of a common parent folder. |
| `output_dir` | If present, it is prepended to all `output` keys used in the rest of the configuration file | This is useful if, like most people, you want all files generated by SwiftGen to be generated in a common directory like `Sources/Generated/` for example. |
| `colors` | Describe the parameters to run with the `colors` subcommand | See below for a detail of all the subkeys. |
| `coredata` | Describe the parameters to run with the `coredata` subcommand | See below for a detail of all the subkeys. |
| `fonts` | Describe the parameters to run with the `fonts` subcommand | See below for a detail of all the subkeys. |
| `ib` | Describe the parameters to run with the `ib` subcommand | See below for a detail of all the subkeys. |
| `json` | Describe the parameters to run with the `json` subcommand | See below for a detail of all the subkeys. |
| `plist` | Describe the parameters to run with the `plist` subcommand | See below for a detail of all the subkeys. |
| `strings` | Describe the parameters to run with the `strings` subcommand | See below for a detail of all the subkeys. |
| `xcassets` | Describe the parameters to run with the `xcassets` subcommand | See below for a detail of all the subkeys. |
| `yaml` | Describe the parameters to run with the `yaml` subcommand | See below for a detail of all the subkeys. |

Each key corresponding to a SwiftGen subcommands (`colors`, `coredata`, `fonts`, `ib`, `json`, `plist`, `strings`, `xcassets`, `yaml`) expects the corresponding value to be:

* Either a dictionary, with the keys described below, if you want to invoke the corresponding SwiftGen subcommand only once (most common use case)
* Or an array of those dictionaries, in the less common case where you need to invoke that SwiftGen subcommand multiple times (for example to use one template with some input files and another template for other input files…)

| Subkey | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `inputs` | Path or Array of Paths | The file(s)/dir(s) to parse (e.g. the path to your assets catalog for the `xcassets` command, or your `Localizable.strings` file for the `strings` command, etc). |
| `filter` | Regular Expression | The regular expression to apply to each input path, only paths matching the given filter will be used. Note that each command has a default built-in filter, which you can override with this option. |
| `outputs` | Array | A list of output descriptions, composed of a template and a file output. |
| `paths` | Path or Array of Paths | **Deprecated** The file(s)/dir(s) to parse (e.g. the path to your assets catalog for the `xcassets` command, or your `Localizable.strings` file for the `strings` command, etc). |
| `templateName` | String | **Deprecated** The name of the template to use. If you provide a value for this, you shouldn't also provide a value for `templatePath`. |
| `templatePath` | Path | **Deprecated** The path to the template to use. If you provide a value for this, you shouldn't also provide a value for `templateName`. |
| `output` | Path | **Deprecated** The path of the output file to generate. _(Note: Any intermediate directory up to this file must already exist.)_ |
| `params` | Dictionary | **Deprecated** Any optional parameter you want to pass to the template (similarly to `--param` in the CLI). |

The `outputs` parameter accepts either a dictionary, or an array of dictionaries, with the keys described below. Each such "output" will take the input files, and use the output template to generate a file at the given output path. This allows you to generate multiple outputs for the same input files (which will only be parsed once).

| Subkey | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `templateName` | String | The name of the template to use. If you provide a value for this, you shouldn't also provide a value for `templatePath`. |
| `templatePath` | Path | The path to the template to use. If you provide a value for this, you shouldn't also provide a value for `templateName`. |
| `output` | Path | The path of the output file to generate. _(Note: Any intermediate directory up to this file must already exist.)_ |
| `params` | Dictionary | Any optional parameter you want to pass to the template (similarly to `--param` in the CLI). |

Similarly to when you invoke each subcommand of SwiftGen manually:

* `inputs` and `outputs` are mandatory.
* You must specify either `templateName` or `templatePath`, but not both, nor neither.
* `params` is optional.

## Advanced options for running the config file

Running `swiftgen` without any subcommand or argument is actually a shortcut invocation which is equivalent to running `swiftgen config run`.

If you need more control when using a configuration file, you can use some advanced features by using the full `swiftgen config run` command to specify more options. In particular you can:

* Ask to use a different config file — instead of the default `swiftgen.yml` — using the `--config` flag.

  ```sh
  swiftgen config run --config tools/swiftgen/swiftgen-config.yml
  ```
  
* Enable the verbose mode, which will print every command being executed when executing it, using the `--verbose` flag. This allows your to:
  * control what is being run, by logging what happens during execution
  * know the equivalent command to type if you were to run each swiftgen command manually instead of using the config file — which can be useful if you need to debug or tweak a particular command in isolation for example

  ```sh
  swiftgen config run --verbose
  ```

## Linting the configuration file

You can also use `swiftgen config lint` (or `Pods/SwiftGen/bin/swiftgen config lint` if you installed it using CocoaPods) to lint the configuration file.

Without any additional option this will lint the default `swiftgen.yml` configuration file, but you can specify a different configuration file using the `--config` flag, similarly to `swiftgen config run`

`swiftgen config lint` will ensure that:

* the YAML file is a valid YAML
* each mandatory key in the YAML is present
* each key is of the expected type.

It will print a descriptive error in case there's something wrong, and describe the interpretation of the content of the configuration file if everything is valid.
